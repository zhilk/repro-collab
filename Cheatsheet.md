### Cheats Sheet: Collaborative Writing on GitHub

**Repository**: The central project folder in GitHub. It stores all files, version history, and collaboration tools (like issues, pull requests, and branches). In collaborative writing, the repository is like your shared document workspace. 

**Fork**: A personal copy of a repository, saved under your own GitHub account. In typical collaborative writing projects, forking is usually *not* needed as collaborators can work directly within the shared repository (e.g., in their own branch). In this workshop, you are asked to fork the repository for technical reasons, so you can work on your own copy instead of editing the original workshop repository directly. The original repository you forked from is also called the upstream repository.

**Branch**: A parallel version of the project, created within the same repository. The main branch represents the current official version of the project. Creating additional, separate branches allows collaborators to work on changes without affecting the main version until their work is ready to be added. After finishing work in a branch, collaborators can open a pull request to suggest adding their changes to the main branch. *Note*: Unlike forks, branches are always part of the shared repository and stay automatically up-to-date with the main branch. 

**Pull Request (PR)**: A way to suggest changes to a project. Pull requests can be made within the same repository (e.g., from a separate branch into the main branch) or from a fork to a branch in the upstream repository. In both cases, they request that your changes are “pulled” into the main branch the target branch. A pull request lets others review your changes, give feedback, and approve them before they are added to the main branch.

**Issue**: A way to track tasks, ideas, or bugs within a specific repository. In collaborative writing, issues help structure work on the text (e.g., outlining sections), discuss revisions, or assign writing tasks.

For example, you can: 
- Create checklists by typing - [ ] followed by your task
- Mention people with @username to notify them directly
- Reference issues or PRs using #issue-number or #PR-number
