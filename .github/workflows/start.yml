            Thank you for forking the repository and getting started with the workshop!

            In this issue we track your progress throughout the workshop.
            Every time you reply with \`/done NUMBER\` this list gets updated:

            - [x] 1. Created GitHub account
            - [x] 2. Fork GitHub repo
            - [ ] 3. Activate issues in your fork

            // 2) Create the issue
            const issue = await github.rest.issues.create({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo:  context.repo.repo,

            Let’s approach this like a true scientist: step by step, with curiosity, precision, and a healthy dose of skepticism (and maybe a coffee or two). 
            If you hit an unexpected result, remember—every great discovery started with a question. 
            Data, documentation, and reproducibility are our friends here.
            
            **Next step:**  
            Please enable “Issues” in your forked repository so we can collaborate, track your progress, and (most importantly) keep a clear record of our scientific journey.
            
            To enable issues:
            
            1. Open your repository's **Settings**: https://github.com/${FORK_REPO}/settings  
            2. Scroll down to the **Features** section.  
            3. Check the box labeled **“Issues”**.  
            4. When finished, reply here with \`/done 3\`.
            
            If something doesn’t match the documentation or you spot an anomaly, don’t hesitate to ask. 
            In science, there are no silly questions, only hypotheses waiting to be tested. 
            Let’s keep things reproducible, transparent, and maybe even a bit fun. 
            Happy experimenting!
