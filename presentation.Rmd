Happy collaborations:

* don't fight with technology, they take advantage of it
* don't engage in edit wars, they have clear responsibilities

--

This is as much as a **technological** challange, as a **sociological** one.


---

Speaking of technology, why can't we use good old:

* Word
* Google Docs / Overleaf
* Google Collab
* Dropbox / Seafile etc.

---

# Word

.pull-left[

## Upside

* everyone can use it
* track changes

]

.pull-right[

## Downside

* only one person at any given time
* no reproducibility

# Google Doc / Overleaf

.pull-left[

## Upside

* everyone can use it
* many people
* ~~track changes~~

]

.pull-right[

## Downside

* anyone can edit everything, without anyone noticing
* no reproducibility

]

---

# Google Collab

.pull-left[

## Upside

# GitHub / GitLab

.pull-left[

## Upside

* reproducibility
* high level of control
* thousands of people can collaborate
* any collaboration workflow is possible

* any collaboration workflow is possible
* highly complex

# This workshop is a beta version

Provide feedback: https://github.com/aaronpeikert/repro-collab/issues/new

---

## What makes an ideal issue?

--

The next step is clear.

1. Discussion
2. Decission
2. Implementation

---

## How can issues be used to organize tasks and responsibilities?

--

* people can voice their opinion in way that is documented
* mentioning via @username to trigger discussion/decision
* people can assign themselves or others

---

## How to get/provide feedback via GitHub?

--

* pull requests are ideally suited to get/provide feedback
* can be integrated into issues
* tracking other peoples contribution via PR is possible

---

## What aspects of your workflow are difficult to translate to GitHub?

---

## How much skill is required?

Either:

**Git Wizard**

.pull-right[

**Project Organization Wizard**

]

Or some of both.

# Making a diff(erence)


* coordinate
* make atomic changes
* commit often, push less often
* use markdown everywhere
* when using markdown place each sentence on its own line
